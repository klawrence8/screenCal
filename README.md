# screenCal
My ongoing mashup screening scraper + calendar program. This web app will help you find underground screenings of foreign arthouse, indie newcomers, or forgotten gems from the golden age on a silver screen near you! Built for the purpose of studying event-driven web dev basics by implementing a Node.js and javascript prototype and routinely refactoring it.
